my portfolio place

for convinience, my projects are divided into difficulty levels: from an easy level with basic formulas and methods to a pro with more sophisticated problems and solutions.

ABOUT ME:
my path to data analytics started in early 2022. 
as i was daily engaged in analytics while being a marketing manager, i figured that analysis is something that drives interest for me.
within next months i started taking courses.

my previous experience with data and analysis has helped me in this journey. 
as i was already exploiting sophisticated excel formulas daily, and regularly engaged in data collection, prep & analytics, the learning process went smoothly and easily.

if to speak more about my practical experience from my previous job: i would constantly lead and manage projects in marketing analytics: 
- prepare business cases,
- prepare documentation and methods for focus groups (consumer insights, offline events),
- analyze distribution, volumes and sales of products to enhance portfolio
- regularly engage with crm databases (exporting and working with a consumer base)

so, my goal going into this data analytics path, is to find a place to grow, apply my knowledge and enrich my experience.
