this is a beginner level project to showcase some of my knowledge.
the study focuses on a small datafram of students who passed or didn't pass the exam with the data of hours they've spent preparing for the exam & the results of a previous exams.

in my analysis i decided to structure data and extract data on mean, min & max indexes, to watch if there's a connection.
i also made a quick look at the data behind correlation between hours spent studying & the final results.
